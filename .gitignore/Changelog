V0.03 "The Money Bag Update!"

-ADDED: Guess The Number! You earn $100 from this if you get it correct (Administrators can stop it with {prefix}gtn_stop)
-ADDED: A Money System! This will be worked on a lot, but for right now, just do (prefix)bal
-ADDED: Feedback so if there is a command that needs arguments (like cleverbot), it helps you if you don't fill in arguments.
-ADDED: $prefix where it tells you the prefix. (It will always be a dollar sign)
-ADDED: DilliBot to respond as cleverbot by just tagging him. So you can now do {prefix}cb <message> or @DilliBot <message>
-ADDED: {prefix}RoastMe where you will get roasted.
-FIXED: A bug where anyone can change the prefixs, it is now set to people with Administrators only.
-MADE: the code multiscript (Please Check "V0.03 readme" on github for more information)
-MADE: It able so commands are no longer case sensitive, making {prefix}ILY and {prefix}ily would do the same thing
-STARTED: Naming The Versions
-REMOVED: $is you ded
